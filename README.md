<h2><b> Some thing about linked lists work</h2>

<p> Linked list is a kind of an array of nodes where one node is linked to other node</p>

<p> normally one sees these kinds of pictures. <br>
 One box with number and dot is a node. <br></p>
 <ul>
  <li>Number = data (it can be int, string or so on..</li>
  <li>Dot = a kind of pointer where the next node lives</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>So a node contains the value of the next node in a sense.<br>

  <br> It is kind of a list where the node contains the next node and the next node contains the next node and so on... <br>
  node = data, next.node <br>
